Enterprise ETL importer for WordPress that turns complex API payloads into reliable, automation-ready content workflows.

== Description ==
Enterprise API Importer gives WordPress teams an enterprise-grade ETL pipeline for importing external API data with confidence.

Use Enterprise API Importer to run clean, repeatable import workflows without sacrificing flexibility:

- Multi-Connection Job Manager for organizing and scaling imports
- React Tabbed Import Job Workspace (Source/Auth, Data Rules, Mapping/Templating, Automation)
- Advanced JSON array traversal and pre-stage data filtering to remove noise before insertion
- Twig Templating Engine for complex logic, loops, and nested object mapping without drag-and-drop limitations
- Twig-powered Post Title Templates with safe sanitization and fallback handling
- Optional templates for new jobs (start with connection setup, add templates later)
- Multiple API auth modes: none, bearer token, custom API-key header, and basic auth
- Per-import Target Post Type selection (posts, pages, and public custom post types)
- Per-import Default Target Settings (post status, post author, comment status, pingback/trackback status)
- Per-import editing lock toggle for imported posts (allow editing or enforce read-only)
- Time-aware batch processing via WP-Cron to reduce timeout and memory-risk scenarios
- **[New v1.2] Tableau-Style Reporting Dashboard:** Real-time metrics on environment health, security posture, and API performance with interactive charts, status indicators, and audit activity feed
- **[New] Enterprise-Grade Security Hardening:**
  - Dedicated template management capability with multisite support
  - Twig template security validation (disallowed tags, size/complexity limits, syntax checking)
  - Template change audit logging with before/after hashes and actor metadata
  - SSRF prevention via hostname and CIDR allowlisting with DNS resolution
  - Twig strict variables mode enabled by default for better error visibility
  - Imported items locked read-only (no editing, deletion, or quick-edit)

Whether you import catalogs, directory records, listings, events, or custom business data, Enterprise API Importer provides a scalable framework for structured API-to-WordPress ETL.

Built for real-world production workflows:

- Title templates are rendered via Twig and sanitized before save
- Target post type safely falls back to post if invalid or unavailable
- Attachment is excluded by default from target post type selection
- Default target post settings are validated and applied at load time for consistent publishing/discussion behavior
- Imports are staged and processed in queue batches for safer long-running jobs
- Imported items are cryptographically linked to their origin import (read-only)
- Template configuration changes are audit-logged with full actor context
- Endpoints validated against configurable SSRF allowlists and HTTPS enforcement
- Inline API connection testing, sample payload preview, and template dry-run rendering from the edit workspace

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install it through the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen in WordPress.
3. Go to EAPI -> Manage Imports to configure your API connections, filtering rules, target post type, and Twig templates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this require WP-CLI? =
No. It uses native WP-Cron scheduling, but supports CLI triggers.

= Can I parse nested JSON arrays? =
Yes. Nested objects and arrays can be parsed and transformed through Twig templating.

= Does it handle API authentication? =
Yes. It supports four modes per import job: none, bearer token, custom API-key header, and basic auth.

= Can I set dynamic titles for imported posts? =
Yes. Use Post Title Template with Twig syntax. If left blank, the importer falls back to Imported Item {ID}.

= Can I import into custom post types? =
Yes. Select any public post type from Target Post Type. If the selected post type becomes unavailable, imports safely fall back to post.

= Does this import media attachments automatically from URL fields? =
The plugin includes a secure media sideload helper foundation with source URL deduplication. Full field-level media mapping workflows can be added on top of this helper.

= Who can edit imported items and templates? =
Template configuration requires the `eai_manage_templates` capability or `manage_options` role. Multisite super admins always have access. Imported item editing can now be controlled per import job with the "Lock editing of imported posts" setting.

= What Twig features are blocked for security? =
The following Twig tags are disallowed to prevent file inclusion and code injection: `include`, `source`, `import`, `from`, `embed`, `extends`, `use`, `macro`.

= Can I allow imports from internal/private networks? =
Yes, but not recommended for production. Go to Settings → Allow Internal Endpoints to permit RFC1918 and loopback addresses. For whitelisting specific hosts/CIDR blocks, use Settings → Allowed Endpoint Hosts and Settings → Allowed Endpoint CIDR Blocks.

= What should I configure in EAPI → Settings first? =
Start with Allowed Endpoint Hosts and list only trusted API domains. Leave Allow Internal Endpoints disabled unless you intentionally import from internal services. Add CIDR blocks only when you need additional IP-range restrictions.

= Where are template changes logged? =
All template configuration changes are logged to the wp_custom_import_logs database table with before/after hashes, actor information, and precise timestamps. Review logs via EAPI → Manage Imports → Import edit screen.

== External services ==
This plugin connects to external APIs that you configure in each import job.

- What service is used: Your configured API endpoint URL.
- What data is sent: Request headers (including optional Bearer token) and normal HTTP request metadata.
- When data is sent: During endpoint tests, dry-run template previews, and scheduled/manual import runs.
- Why data is sent: To fetch remote JSON payloads for preview, transform, and import workflows.

**Security policy notes:**

- Configure only trusted API endpoints that you control or explicitly trust.
- **HTTPS is required by default** for all endpoints (can be disabled via code filter for development).
- **Private/internal network hosts are blocked by default** (RFC1918 ranges and loopback). Enable only if you need to import from internal APIs in controlled environments.
- **Hostname allowlisting:** Restrict imports to specific domains (exact or wildcard subdomains). Configure at Settings → Allowed Endpoint Hosts.
- **CIDR allowlisting:** Restrict imports to specific IPv4/IPv6 network ranges. Configure at Settings → Allowed Endpoint CIDR Blocks.
- **Endpoint validation:** All endpoints are validated before request execution.
- **Audit logging:** All endpoint changes and template modifications are logged with full actor context.

The plugin does not hardcode any third-party API vendor. Data destination, terms, and privacy practices depend on the endpoint(s) you configure.

== Changelog ==
= 1.2.0 =
* **Updated: React Import Job Workspace**
  - Replaced the legacy linear create/edit form with a tabbed workspace in wp-admin.
  - Added sticky footer actions for save, run now, and update existing item content.
* **Updated: REST Import Job CRUD + actions**
  - Added REST routes for create/read/update import jobs and run/template sync actions.
  - Added centralized sanitization for import job payloads used by create/update handlers.
* **Updated: API validation and preview tooling**
  - Added in-workspace API test button with sample record preview support.
  - Added Twig dry-run test support from the Mapping & Templating tab.
* **Updated: Authentication model**
  - Added four auth methods per import job: none, bearer, custom API-key header, and basic auth.
* **Updated: Optional templates for new imports**

* **Updated: Per-import editing lock control**
  - Added "Lock editing of imported posts" toggle in Mapping & Templating.

* **New: Enterprise Reporting Dashboard (Tableau-Style)**
  - Real-time operations command center with global health status badge and force-refresh controls.
  - Nine enterprise-grade metrics across three pillars:
    - **Environment Health:** Cron heartbeat, queue depth, daily success rate.
    - **Security & Compliance:** SSRF hardening status, audit integrity tracking, protocol enforcement (HTTPS vs HTTP).
